    <string name="about_me">My name is Kutaiba Nezar kashmar. I know I know my name is kind of weird and maybe a bit hard to read but in the same time I think it is kind of cool.
but you know what else is cool… having a library of every cool character from your favorite movie, show or game. and who knows maybe even more.
No but seriously,  The multiverse of Geeks is an Android app where the user can explore various movies and video games characters and their lure.
Furthermore, the user can leave comments, rate characters, and more.
The motivation behind this app is to have a place where the user can keep track and interact with the geek community through
common interests such as movies and video games all in one app.
Let me tell you more about my self. I am a software engineering student at VIA university Collage -university located in Midtjylland Denmark- and this app is part of the android development program.
In other words this is my first -more or less- complex android app. I love programing, acutely… I love anything has to do with computers and tech. You might have already figure this out that I love gaming and watching movies and video games.
Below there are links to my social media and github. If you have an advice or feedback PLEASE don\'t hesitate to contact me. enjoy best regards.
